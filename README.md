The mythycal *mix* machine.

Ok, this is a simple project writing my first compiler.
It consist of two parts, first is to build machine
instructions from source code, and the second is to
actually execute those instructions.

For now I'm kind of a ready with the first part, but it's
very buggy, but I have to start from somewhere:)
