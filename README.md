The mythical *mix* machine.

Ok, this is a simple project writing my first Compiler.
It consist of two parts, first is to build machine
instructions from source code, and the second is to
actually execute those instructions.

For now I'm kind of a ready with the first part, but it's
very buggy, but I have to start from somewhere:)

At this point I'm almost ready with the second part
as well. What remains is to write the GO button and
run the machine, actually what I'm suspecting is that,
I'll have to fix a lot of bugs. Then I'm going to start
writing the GUI and the Interpreter.
